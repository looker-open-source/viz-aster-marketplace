#### Quickstart Dev Instructions
1.  **Install Dependecies.**

    Using yarn, install all dependencies
    ```
    yarn
    ```
2. **Make changes to the source code**
    
    The unminified .js file can be found in `./src/aster_plot_src.js`

3.  **Compile your code**

    No real compilation for this viz but we'll want to minify the source code for distribution. You can do so by running:
    ```
    yarn build
    ```

**`aster_plot.js`**: This visualization's minified distribution file. 

**`LICENSE`**: Looker's Marketplace content License file.

**`manifest.lkml`**: Looker's external dependencies configuration file. The visualization object is defined here.

**`marketplace.json`**: A JSON file containing information the marketplace installer uses to set up this project.

**`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the visualization's source code.

**`README.md`**: This! A text file containing useful reference information about this visualization.

**`yarn.lock`**: [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is a package manager alternative to npm. This file serves essentially the same purpose as `package-lock.json`, just for a different package management system.
